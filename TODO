Todo now (for integrating into scrotwm)
   3. add flag to customize strftime(3) flag
   4. patch into scrotwm
         -> has bug w/ handling regions, can't figure out (April 2010)
         -> F*&$! the regions bug is bad (Jul 2010)
   5. document that swap usage is shown only if it's used

List of stuff to add when i ... well, care enough to do so...

   *  If volume is muted, indicate that somehow...

   *  ADD/FIX brightness... still dunno "which" brightness to query/collect
      (the Xrandr one via xbacklight, or the "other" one controlled by my
      laptop-buttons.  they appear to be different)

   *  ADD just a quick glance at network activity of each if (??)
